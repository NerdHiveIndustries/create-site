Initially forked from: https://bitbucket.org/intel352/nginx-vhost/src

This project provides a simple shell script to generate a vhost directory.
This project is built on/for Ubuntu servers configured using our server setup (https://gist.github.com/2123030), and will likely not work on other platforms.

Dependencies:
ack-grep

Expects script to be executed by a user that can write to /var/www.
Expects Nginx to already be installed

Bottom of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf "http {" block should have a line like the following:
    include /var/www/*/config/nginx.conf;


Example setup and usage:
# git clone git://github.com/NerdHiveIndustries/create-site.git /var/www/
# cd /var/www/
# chmod +x create_site # Make the script executable
# /var/www/create_site test.mysite.com # Execute the script

Files are then copied into /var/www/ (VHOSTDIR) as /var/www/test.mysite.com/
That directory contains:
backup/
config/     # Per-domain nginx config is stored here
site/
